# Remap-Canoe-Controller

This hmod allows you to edit the controller inputs in Canoe.
                  
The A and B buttons are modified already, A acts as B and B acts as A.

Any controller connected to the ports at the front will be recognized as Nintendo Clovercon.

You can edit gamecontrollerdb.txt BEFORE you install the hmod, if you wish.

Updated current database with additional 60 controllers for future purpose.
